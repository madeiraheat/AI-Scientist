    "Summary": "The paper introduces an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low-dimensional diffusion models, incorporating a novel architecture with two parallel branches (global and local) and a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism. This aims to balance global structure and local details in generated samples. The method is evaluated on four diverse 2D datasets: circle, dino, line, and moons, showing some improvements in sample quality with some reductions in KL divergence.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses an important and practical problem in applying diffusion models to low-dimensional data.",
        "Introduces a novel dual-scale architecture with adaptive weighting to balance global and local features.",
        "Comprehensive experimental evaluations on multiple datasets.",
        "Visualization of weight evolution across timesteps provides insight into model behavior."
