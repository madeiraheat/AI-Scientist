{"Summary": "The paper explores the effect of data augmentation on grokking dynamics in mathematical operations, focusing on modular arithmetic. It introduces a data augmentation strategy combining operand reversal and negation, which is tested using a transformer-based model across multiple configurations. Results show that these augmentations significantly accelerate grokking across addition, subtraction, and division operations.", "Strengths": ["Addresses the intriguing phenomenon of grokking in deep learning, particularly in mathematical reasoning tasks.", "Employs a novel application of data augmentation specifically tailored to modular arithmetic operations.", "Presents empirical evidence showing significant reductions in training steps to achieve high validation accuracy."], "Weaknesses": ["Theoretical analysis supporting the empirical findings is insufficient. The paper could benefit from a deeper exploration of why certain augmentation strategies work better for specific operations.", "Details on the autoencoder aggregator and other technical components are sparse, making it difficult to fully understand the methodology.", "The augmentation strategies, while effective, are somewhat simplistic and may not generalize well to more complex or diverse mathematical tasks.", "The experimental setup and hyperparameters are fixed without justification, raising concerns about the robustness and generalizability of the results.", "The clarity of the methodology section is lacking, particularly in the description of the training procedure and the specific details of the data augmentation techniques.", "The paper does not sufficiently address potential limitations and ethical concerns associated with the proposed method."], "Originality": 3, "Quality": 2, "Clarity": 2, "Significance": 3, "Questions": ["Can you provide more theoretical analysis on why operand reversal and negation augmentations improve grokking dynamics?", "Please elaborate on the autoencoder aggregator and its role in the augmentation process.", "Have you considered more complex or varied augmentation strategies, and if so, how do they compare to the ones tested?", "What is the impact of these augmentation strategies on tasks beyond modular arithmetic?", "How were the hyperparameters chosen, and how might different hyperparameter settings affect the results?", "Can the authors provide more detailed descriptions of the training procedure and the specific implementations of the augmentation techniques?", "What are the potential limitations and ethical considerations of this work?", "Have you considered other model architectures or hyperparameters in your experiments?", "Can you provide additional ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed data augmentation techniques?", "Would the proposed augmentation strategies be effective for more complex mathematical operations or other domains?", "Can the authors include more diverse mathematical operations in their evaluation to strengthen their findings?", "How does the proposed method compare to other potential strategies for enhancing grokking, such as different model architectures or training techniques?", "Can you provide more details and examples to clarify the methodology section?", "Have you tested the generalizability of your approach to other mathematical tasks or model architectures?
