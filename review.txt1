    "Summary": "The paper proposes an adaptive dual-scale denoising approach for low-dimensional diffusion models to balance global structure and local details in generated samples. The method introduces two parallel branches for processing the original input and an upscaled version, with a learnable, timestep-conditioned weighting mechanism to adjust their contributions dynamically. The approach is evaluated on four 2D datasets, showing improvements in sample quality and KL divergence.",
    "Strengths": [
        "The paper tackles a well-defined and practical problem in low-dimensional diffusion models.",
        "The proposed dual-scale architecture and adaptive weighting mechanism are novel and interesting.",
        "The paper provides quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrating improvements in sample quality."

    "Weaknesses": [
        "The paper lacks sufficient ablation studies to fully understand the contribution of each component of the proposed approach.",
        "There is limited discussion on the limitations and potential negative societal impacts of the work.",
        "The clarity of the paper is compromised by the lack of detailed explanations of some components, such as the autoencoder aggregator.",
        "The paper does not compare its approach with other state-of-the-art methods beyond the baseline single-scale diffusion model.",
        "The novelty of the approach is limited as multi-scale and adaptive weighting mechanisms have been explored in various contexts within generative modeling.",
        "The evaluation is limited to four simple 2D datasets, which might not be sufficient to demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of the method.",
        "The computational efficiency is a concern, with training times approximately doubling.",
        "The proposed method's applicability to higher-dimensional data is not convincingly demonstrated.",
        "The presentation of the results could be improved with more detailed visualizations and additional cases."
